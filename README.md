## Description
This is a Javascript program to simulate dice addition statistics.
It uses combinitorial math to predict the liklihood for dice sums used in popular games like D&D and Catan.
You can use the autorun feature to see if the predictions hold true.


## Issues
- Output prediction gets wonky with more than 15 dice due to maxInt issues
- Sizing of the screen is weird
- Fix tooltips

## Planned Features
- Add D20 functionality
- Add other types of dice
- Allow option for rolling with advantage (highest of the dice counts) along with prediction model for that
- Allow more than one type of dice on the field
