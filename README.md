# Dice

## Issues
Output prediction gets wonky with more than 15 dice due to maxInt issues
Sizing of the screen is weird

## Planned Features
Add D20 functionality
Add other types of dice
Allow option for rolling with advantage (highest of the dice counts) along with prediction model for that
Allow more than one type of dice on the field
